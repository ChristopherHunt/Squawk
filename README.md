##BeagleBoneBlack (BBB) Motion Sensitive Alarm Clock

A project to create an alarm clock which is silenced (put to sleep) by detecting
relative acceleration changes. In other words, an alarm clock that beeps until
you bump the table it is on (at which point is turns off). The main motivation
for this project is to have a clock that is easy to silence by a drowsy person 
waking up.
